# Work In Progress...

For the first, almost at glance look, it appears that the overall best performer is the Logistic Regression Model with TF-IDF Embeddings on Preprocessed Text. 
At the second step, re-evaluation of text preprocessing, models hyperparameters fine tuning, and implementation of a Neural Network Model will be done. 

# Repository Information:
in src there are some scripts that are re-usable (data_preprocessing.py, utils.py, and prepare_embeddings.py), and model_comparison.py which is auxiliary to run different tests to have an idea which model is the best performer.
